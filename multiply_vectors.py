# 1. Multiply Vectors
# Given two lists of numbers of the same length, create a new list by multiplying the pairs of numbers in corresponding positions in the two lists. Example:

# [2, 4, 5] x [2, 3, 6] = [4, 12, 30]
# import numpy as np
# import math

a = [[2, 4, 5]]
print("Vector-1")
print(a)
b = [4, 12, 30]
print("Vector-2")
print(b)
result = a * b
print("Multiply the values of two said vectors:")
print(result)
